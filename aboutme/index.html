        Hi everyone! My name is James Vang and I am happy to take this course with you all
        this semester! I am from Sacramento, CA originally but am currently living in Rexburg, ID.
        I am married and my wife and I have 3 children.  
    </p>
    <p>
        Some things that I like to do is watch movies and shows. I love cars, computers, food and
        a little time for games. I love watching ym kids learn as they are growing and am learning 
        everyday how to be a better husband and father for my family. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I hope that this semester we are all able to learn understand the things in this course. I 
        am learning and hope to be able to understand and implement the things that I will learn 
        in this course in the assignments we will be given.
